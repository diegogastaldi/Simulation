Simulation
==========
Copy semaphore.h and semaphore.cpp and street.h and street.cpp in the C:\PowerDEVS\atomics\sources

Same with car_generator.cpp and car_generator.h and corner.h and corner.cpp

Note:
- If on the corner, the cars have less speed on That street, 
  then ignore the corner many cars.

  For that the system no collapse, or the street that runs from two corner to one corner decender its 
  speed or the one corner increase its speed.
